This section provides a detailed description of the key components and steps involved in initializing, running, and training a BERT-like Transformer neural network, including specific functions for layer normalization, residual connections, and other important processes.
1. Initialization:

Initialization involves setting up the Transformer model based on specified parameters, allocating memory for matrices, and initializing weights using Xavier initialization.

- Function: Matrix_t create_matrix(int rows, int cols, int alignment)
    Allocates and initializes a matrix with specified dimensions and alignment.
- Function: void xavier_init(Matrix_t *matrix)
    Initializes the matrix weights using Xavier initialization to ensure proper scaling.
- Function: void position_encoding(Matrix_t *matrix)
    Computes position encodings for the input matrix to provide positional information.

2. Forward Pass:

The forward pass involves processing the input through multiple Transformer layers, each consisting of attention heads, linear transformations, layer normalization, and residual connections. Additionally, an extra linear neural network layer is used for classification in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.

    Function: void attention_heads(TransformerLayer_t *layer, Matrix_t *input)
        Computes the multi-head attention mechanism.
    Function: void linear_transformer(TransformerLayer_t *layer, Matrix_t *input)
        Applies linear transformations to the input.
    Function: void layer_norm_residual(TransformerLayer_t *layer, Matrix_t *input, Matrix_t *output)
        Performs layer normalization and adds a residual connection.
    Function: void ner_classification_layer(Transformer_t *transformer, Matrix_t *input)
        Adds a classification layer for NER tasks, outputting classification scores.

3. Backpropagation:

Backpropagation involves calculating the loss, computing gradients, and updating model weights using the Adam optimizer.

    Function: void calculate_loss(Matrix_t *predictions, Matrix_t *labels)
        Computes the cross-entropy loss between the predictions and the true labels.
    Function: void backpropagation(Transformer_t *transformer, Matrix_t *input, Matrix_t *output)
        Calculates the gradients for all layers and updates weights accordingly.
    Function: void adam_optimizer_update(Transformer_t *transformer)
        Updates the model weights using the Adam optimization algorithm.

Detailed Components
Layer Normalization and Residual Connection

Layer normalization and residual connections are crucial for stabilizing the training of deep neural networks. In each Transformer layer, the output of the sub-layer (such as attention or feedforward network) is normalized and then added to the original input (residual connection).

    Layer Normalization:
        Normalizes the input to have zero mean and unit variance, which helps in stabilizing and accelerating the training process.
        Implemented in the layer_norm_residual function.

    Residual Connection:
        Adds the input of a layer to its output to facilitate gradient flow and enable training of deep networks.
        Also implemented in the layer_norm_residual function.

Attention Mechanism

The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence for each attention head, improving its ability to capture relationships within the data.

    Multi-Head Attention:
        Splits the input into multiple heads, each head performs scaled dot-product attention, and then concatenates the results.
        Implemented in the attention_heads function.

Feedforward Network

Each Transformer layer includes a feedforward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. It consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

    Feedforward Network:
        Applies linear transformations followed by a ReLU activation.
        Implemented in the linear_transformer function.

Classification Layer for NER

A final linear layer is added to map the output of the Transformer to the desired number of classes for NER tasks.

    Classification Layer:
        Maps the encoded representations to classification scores.
        Implemented in the ner_classification_layer function.
